## Installation

### Classical Installation

You can host DecoPath locally using Docker. To do so, follow these steps,

#### Prerequisites
- In order to host DecoPath, make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on you system (See [How to 
install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [How to install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
- (Optional) Obtain a domain name in case you are installing DecoPath for your entire institution
- (Optional) Setup port forwarding for your system if you decide to set up DecoPath with a domain

#### Setting up DecoPath
1. Clone and download DecoPath from GitHub.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/decopath/decopath.git
$ cd decopath
```
2. Generate a SECRET_KEY for password encryption using the code below, and add the generated text to the 
   [settings file](./DecoPath/settings.py) at line 23.
```bash
$ python3.7 generate_secret_key.py
```
3. If you decided to host DecoPath on a separate domain, **change "domain.com" with your domain name** in the 
   **[settings file](./DecoPath/settings.py)** and the **[docker-compose file](./docker-compose.yaml)**. However, if 
   you are **not using a domain name**, you would need to **remove the string "domain.com"** from both the files.
   
   Additionally, you also need to **update the admin email address** in **docker-compose file** (default admin 
   password: admin).
4. Build the DecoPath image using Docker,
```bash
$ docker image build -t decopath:latest .
```
5. Start the docker image using docker-compose.
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

**Note**: If you wish to host DecoPath using your own domain, you might need to change the ports in
the [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml) file to reflect your port-forwarding configuration (See [Networking in 
Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/)).

#### Deployment using a Web Server
DecoPath, out of the box, is installed in development mode. And in order to deploy it you would need to turn off the 
deployment setting, you need to change the "DEBUG" variable in the [settings file](./DecoPath/settings.py) from 
"True" to "False". And serve static files along with the website using a web server of your choosing, 
such as [nginx](https://www.cleanpython.com/how-to-use-nginx-with-your-django-docker-image/)

### For developers

DecoPath is provided as a Python 3.7 package that you can customize and edit the functionality of. You can clone the 
repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/decopath/decopath) and set up the website.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/decopath/decopath.git
$ cd decopath
$ python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3.7 manage.py makemigrations
$ python3.7 manage.py migrate
$ python3.7 manage.py load_db
$ python3.7 manage.py init_user --superuser "user@domain.com"
$ python3.7 manage.py runserver
```

**Note**: Replace "user@domain.com" with the administrator Email ID (default admin password: admin).

And RabbitMQ & Celery can be setup using,

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rabbitmq -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=user -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=password -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST=vhost -p 8080:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:management
$ pip install celery
$ celery -A DecoPath worker -l info
```

**Note**: To obtain fold changes, the DESeq2 package must first be installed. To do so, start R and enter:

```bash
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

#### GSEA and large gene sets

To speed up a GSEA run with large gene sets, you can clone this
[branch](https://github.com/DecoPath/DecoPath/tree/increase_processes) to enable multi-processing. Then, alter the
number of processes [here](https://github.com/DecoPath/DecoPath/blob/increase_processes/viewer/src/gsea.py).
